# Security-Only Cleaning Duties Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of new rule: **Only security staff are allowed to clean kitchen and do bins**

## Version Update
- **Previous Version:** 3.1.1
- **New Version:** 3.1.2
- **Implementation Date:** August 30, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Logic Changes

#### New Security-Only Duties Array
- Added `securityOnlyDuties` array containing `["KITCHEN", "TAKE OUT BINS"]`
- These duties are now restricted to security staff only

#### Modified `assignCleaningDuties()` Function
- **FIRST PASS:** Assigns security-only duties (Kitchen & Take Out Bins) exclusively to security staff
- **SECOND PASS:** Assigns remaining regular duties to regular staff (excluding security staff and nurses in charge)
- **Fallback:** If no security staff available, security-only duties remain unassigned with warning

### 2. User Interface Enhancements

#### Visual Indicators
- **ðŸ”’ Lock Icon:** Added to security-only duties in duty lists
- **Red Security Badge:** "SECURITY ONLY" label for kitchen and bins duties
- **Color Coding:** Red background (#dc3545) for security-only duties vs purple for regular duties

#### Interactive Popup Improvements
- **Title Enhancement:** Shows "ðŸ”’ DUTY NAME (SECURITY ONLY)" for restricted duties
- **Staff Filtering:** Popup only shows security staff for security-only duties
- **Warning Messages:** 
  - Yellow notice explaining security-only restriction
  - Red alert if no security staff available

#### Legend Updates
- Added new legend item: "ðŸ”’ Security-Only Duties (Kitchen & Bins)"
- Distinguished from regular cleaning duties

### 3. Assignment Logic

#### Security-Only Duties
- **Kitchen:** Only assignable to security staff
- **Take Out Bins:** Only assignable to security staff
- **Round-robin assignment:** Distributed among available security staff

#### Regular Duties
- **All other cleaning duties:** Assigned to regular staff only
- **Exclusions:** Security staff, nurses in charge cannot be assigned regular duties
- **Fair distribution:** Maintains existing balanced assignment logic

## Error Handling

### No Security Staff Available
- Security-only duties remain unassigned
- Warning logged to console
- Visual indicator in UI shows "No security staff available"
- Tracked in `staffStats.unassignedSecurityDuties`

### Mixed Assignment Prevention
- System prevents regular staff from being assigned kitchen/bins duties
- System prevents security staff from being assigned regular cleaning duties
- Clear separation of responsibilities

## Benefits

1. **Compliance:** Enforces security protocol for sensitive areas (kitchen, waste disposal)
2. **Clear Responsibility:** Security staff handle areas requiring higher security clearance
3. **Visual Clarity:** Users can immediately identify restricted duties
4. **Flexible Assignment:** Other cleaning duties remain assignable to regular staff
5. **Error Prevention:** UI prevents invalid assignments

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with security staff present:** Verify kitchen and bins assign to security only
2. **Test without security staff:** Verify duties remain unassigned with warnings
3. **Test regular duties:** Verify other cleaning duties still assign to regular staff
4. **Test UI interaction:** Verify popup shows correct staff lists based on duty type
5. **Test visual indicators:** Verify all security-only duties show proper styling
