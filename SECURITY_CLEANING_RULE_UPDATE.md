## Version Updates
- **Previous Version:** 3.1.1
- **Interim Version:** 3.1.2 (Security-Only Cleaning)
- **Color Version:** 3.1.3 (+ Consistent Staff Colors)
- **Design Version:** 3.1.4 (+ Clean Table Design)
- **OBS Version:** 3.1.5 (+ Clean OBS Design)

## 📊 WORK HOURS FIX v3.1.7

### **ISSUE RESOLVED**: OBS Work Hours Not Counted
**Problem**: Staff assigned to OBS (Ward Observation) duties were not getting their work hours incremented in the Staff Statistics table.

### **Impact**: 
- Staff Statistics table showed incorrect (lower) work hour counts
- OBS assignments were not being counted as "work time"
- Work hour calculations were inaccurate for scheduling fairness

### **Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Increment work hours for OBS assignment
if (staffStats[selectedStaff]) {
    staffStats[selectedStaff].workHours++;
}
```

### **Fix Applied To**:
1. **Multi-staff OBS selection** - When multiple staff available for OBS
2. **Single-staff OBS assignment** - When only one staff available for OBS
3. **Both assignment paths** now properly increment work hours

### **Testing Results**:
- ✅ OBS assignments now count toward total work hours
- ✅ Staff Statistics table shows accurate work hour totals
- ✅ Work hour calculations include all assignments (patients + OBS)
- ✅ Fair rotation logic now has correct work hour data

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX v3.1.6

### **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Staff Double-Assignment Conflicts
**Problem**: Staff members were being assigned to multiple patients simultaneously, creating safety violations.

### **Conflicts Found & Fixed**:
- SC assigned to both TSS and CAC at 22:00-23:00
- AG assigned to both TSS and CAC at 03:00-04:00  
- AG assigned to both CAC and TD at 04:00-05:00
- MS & BW both assigned to TSS and CAC at 05:00-06:00
- SC assigned to both TSS and CAC at 06:00-07:00

### **Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Assignment Validation** - Double-check before final assignment
2. **Strengthened Available Staff Filtering** - Filter conflicts during selection
3. **Post-Assignment Validation System** - Auto-fix any remaining conflicts
4. **Enhanced Manual Assignment Protection** - Prevent user-created conflicts

## PREVIOUS UPDATE v3.1.5: Clean OBS Design
