# Security-Only Cleaning Duties + Consistent Staff Color Coding Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of three major features:
1. **Security-Only Rule**: Only security staff are allowed to clean kitchen and do bins
2. **Consistent Staff Colors**: Each staff member gets a unique color that follows them throughout the entire site
3. **Clean Table Design**: Removed background colors from main tables for cleaner appearance

## Version Updates
- **Previous Version:** 3.1.1
- **Interim Version:** 3.1.2 (Security-Only Cleaning)
- **Color Version:** 3.1.3 (+ Consistent Staff Colors)
- **Design Version:** 3.1.4 (+ Clean Table Design)
- **OBS Version:** 3.1.5 (+ Clean OBS Design)
- **üö® CRITICAL VERSION:** 3.1.6 (+ Fixed Staff Double-Assignment Conflicts)
- **üìä STATS VERSION:** 3.1.7 (+ Fixed OBS Work Hours Calculation)
- **üóëÔ∏è SECURITY VERSION:** 3.1.8 (+ Fixed Security-Only Duties Assignment)
- **‚è∞ CONTINUITY VERSION:** 3.1.9 (+ Allow Staff Continuity During Early Night Shift)
- **Implementation Date:** August 30, 2025

## ‚è∞ EARLY NIGHT SHIFT CONTINUITY v3.1.9

### **FEATURE ADDED**: Staff Continuity During 20:00-22:00
**Enhancement**: Staff can now continue working with the same patient during the **first 2 hours of night shift** (20:00-21:00 and 21:00-22:00).

### **Rationale**: 
- **Shift Transition**: First 2 hours are critical transition period from day shift
- **Continuity Benefits**: Same staff can maintain patient care during handover period
- **Stability**: Reduces disruption during shift change

### **Implementation**:
```javascript
// SPECIAL CASE: Allow continuity during first 2 hours of night shift (20:00-22:00)
const isEarlyNightShift = timeIndex < 2; // First 2 time slots

if (isEarlyNightShift) {
    // During first 2 hours: Much reduced penalties to allow continuity
    continuityPenaltyA = continuousHoursA >= 4 ? 500 : (continuousHoursA >= 3 ? 50 : 0);
    continuityPenaltyB = continuousHoursB >= 4 ? 500 : (continuousHoursB >= 3 ? 50 : 0);
} else {
    // Normal hours: Standard penalties to encourage rotation
    continuityPenaltyA = continuousHoursA >= 3 ? 1000 : (continuousHoursA >= 2 ? 100 : 0);
    continuityPenaltyB = continuousHoursB >= 3 ? 1000 : (continuousHoursB >= 2 ? 100 : 0);
}
```

### **Behavior Changes**:
- ‚úÖ **20:00-21:00 ‚Üí 21:00-22:00**: Same staff can continue with same patient
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Rotation Pressure**: Lower penalties for consecutive assignments
- ‚úÖ **After 22:00**: Normal rotation rules apply to encourage fairness
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Console shows when early night shift continuity is allowed

### **Benefits**:
- **Smoother Transitions**: Better patient care continuity during shift change
- **Reduced Confusion**: Same staff familiar with patient condition
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Natural flow from day shift assignments

## üóëÔ∏è SECURITY DUTIES FIX v3.1.8

### **ISSUE RESOLVED**: TAKE OUT BINS Not Assigned to Security Staff
**Problem**: When there was only one security staff member, only the first security duty (KITCHEN) was being assigned, leaving TAKE OUT BINS unassigned.

### **Root Cause**: 
Logic error in assignment condition:
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
if (securityDutyIndex < securityStaff.length) {
    // This failed when securityDutyIndex (1) >= securityStaff.length (1)
}
```

### **Impact**: 
- TAKE OUT BINS showed as "Not Assigned" 
- Violated mandatory security-only rule for bin duties
- Only first security duty assigned per security staff member

### **Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// FIXED CODE - Removed restrictive condition:
securityOnlyDuties.forEach(duty => {
    // Always assign security duties, cycling through security staff if needed
    const securityMember = securityStaff[securityDutyIndex % securityStaff.length];
    // ... assignment logic
    securityDutyIndex++;
});
```

### **Fix Results**:
- ‚úÖ Both KITCHEN and TAKE OUT BINS now assigned to security staff
- ‚úÖ Single security staff member can receive multiple security duties
- ‚úÖ No more "Not Assigned" for mandatory security duties
- ‚úÖ Added console logging for better debugging

## üìä WORK HOURS FIX v3.1.7

### **ISSUE RESOLVED**: OBS Work Hours Not Counted
**Problem**: Staff assigned to OBS (Ward Observation) duties were not getting their work hours incremented in the Staff Statistics table.

### **Impact**: 
- Staff Statistics table showed incorrect (lower) work hour counts
- OBS assignments were not being counted as "work time"
- Work hour calculations were inaccurate for scheduling fairness

### **Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Increment work hours for OBS assignment
if (staffStats[selectedStaff]) {
    staffStats[selectedStaff].workHours++;
}
```

### **Fix Applied To**:
1. **Multi-staff OBS selection** - When multiple staff available for OBS
2. **Single-staff OBS assignment** - When only one staff available for OBS
3. **Both assignment paths** now properly increment work hours

### **Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ OBS assignments now count toward total work hours
- ‚úÖ Staff Statistics table shows accurate work hour totals
- ‚úÖ Work hour calculations include all assignments (patients + OBS)
- ‚úÖ Fair rotation logic now has correct work hour data

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX v3.1.6

### **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Staff Double-Assignment Conflicts
**Problem**: Staff members were being assigned to multiple patients simultaneously, creating safety violations.

### **Conflicts Found & Fixed**:
- SC assigned to both TSS and CAC at 22:00-23:00
- AG assigned to both TSS and CAC at 03:00-04:00  
- AG assigned to both CAC and TD at 04:00-05:00
- MS & BW both assigned to TSS and CAC at 05:00-06:00
- SC assigned to both TSS and CAC at 06:00-07:00

### **Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Assignment Validation** - Double-check before final assignment
2. **Strengthened Available Staff Filtering** - Filter conflicts during selection
3. **Post-Assignment Validation System** - Auto-fix any remaining conflicts
4. **Enhanced Manual Assignment Protection** - Prevent user-created conflicts

## PREVIOUS UPDATE v3.1.5: Clean OBS Design

### OBS Background Color Removal
- **Patient Care Schedule**: Removed green background from OBS assignment cells
