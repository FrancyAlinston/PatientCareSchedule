# Patient Care Schedule Management System

**Version 3.0.0** | Last Updated: July 19, 2025

## Overview

The Patient Care Schedule Management System is a **fully standalone** web-based application designed to automate staff scheduling for healthcare facilities. This tool creates balanced shift allocations for healthcare workers while ensuring patients always have proper coverage, breaks are distributed fairly, and special duties are assigned appropriately.

**üÜï NEW: Completely standalone - no server or external dependencies required!**

## Key Features

- **Fully Standalone**: No server, internet connection, or external dependencies required
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved in your browser's local storage for persistence
- **Offline Ready**: Works completely offline once loaded in your browser

- **Interactive Staff Management**: Real-time staff reassignment with visual feedback and clickable cells
- **Shift Management**: Switch between day shift (8AM-8PM) and night shift (8PM-8AM) scheduling
- **Staff Assignment**: Schedule healthcare workers, security staff, and nurses in charge
- **Patient Coverage**: Ensure patients are never left unattended, with configurable staff-to-patient ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1)
- **OBS (Ward Observation)**: Special assignment for observation duties with one-staff-at-a-time rule
- **Break Scheduling**: Automatically assign and manage staff breaks with smart interruption handling
- **Night Shift Duties**: Automatically distribute cleaning duties during night shifts with interactive reassignment
- **Staff Rotation Tracking**: Monitor how frequently staff members work with specific patients to ensure fair rotation
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark display modes with adaptive color schemes
- **Manual Override**: Click any cell to manually reassign staff with intuitive popup interface

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rules

2. **Enter Staff Information**: Add healthcare worker names, patient names, and security staff
3. **Configure Patient Care**: Select staff-to-patient ratios for each patient (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1)
4. **Choose Shift Type**: Toggle between day shift or night shift using the toggle button
5. **Generate Initial Schedule**: Click "Generate Schedule" to create the automated assignment

- **Cleaning Duties**: Click on "Assigned To" cells in the Night Shift Cleaning Duties Summary
- **OBS Assignment**: Click on OBS time slots to assign/reassign observation staff

## Advanced Features

### Staff Continuity Management
The system monitors how long each staff member continuously works with the same patient and provides warnings when the duration exceeds recommended limits. This promotes patient safety and prevents staff fatigue.

### Dynamic Staff Rotation
The scheduling algorithm considers staff rotation history to ensure fair distribution of patient assignments over time, preventing staff from working with the same patients repeatedly.

### Security Staff Integration
Security personnel have specialized schedules that incorporate both security duties during critical hours and patient care during other times, maximizing resource utilization.
